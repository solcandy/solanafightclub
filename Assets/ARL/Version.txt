Description:
	Connect your Solana wallet and find a match. 3% Fee is taken by the House. 50% is assigned to the Team and 50% remaining is used to buy and burn $SFC Tokens.
	$SFC is the Native and Governance Token. The Initial Supply is 100,000,000. There will be a fair sale of the token with a fixed price to avoid whales pumping and dumping. 5% injected at Liquidity Pool. 30% Reserved for staking prizes (2 years). 15% For Leagues and Tournaments. 30% as Reward Prizes for players. 10% For Marketing purposes. 10% Allocated to the Team in a 24 times monthly payment.
	The Supply, Price and Date is still TBA. The whitelist will mint with a 30% discount with $SFC. Public will mint with SOL.
	30% From $SFC supply is reserved for Leagues and Tournaments. There will be different divisions and special events where best Solana Fight Club Players will fight for generous prizes. Bounties and Loyalty program prizes will be taken from this allocation.
	Staking your NFT will bring you some extra $SFC Tokens. Staking rewards are still TBA as Supply is still not announced.
	The game is still early and Fight 2 Earn is still not working but the more fights you play, the more rewards you will receive. Free Mints, $SFC airdrops and Whitelist will be given for our early adopter players.
	The $SFC presale will be performed in a safe way. Instead of launching the liquidity pool with no owners and make a blood bath, you will have the opportunity to purchase your tokens in advance, ensuring an entry price. In this way, we avoid insiders and commercial agreements that could negatively affect the $SFC ecosystem. The initial $SBF price will be calculated in this way: (5% Supply - Presale tokens purchased) * Presale fundraise. 5% from total supply is 5,000,000.
